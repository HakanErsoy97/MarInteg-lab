# YTU-Robotics Lab 🤖
Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the **Yıldız Technical University Robotics Laboratory**. This repository is dedicated to collaboration between students, researchers, and instructors working on embedded systems, robotics, VHDL/FPGA development, and control systems.

## 🔍 Purpose
This repository serves as a central hub for:
- Uploading and versioning student code
- Sharing design files and project documentation
- Collaborating on research-related software and hardware development

## 📁 Repository Structure
You may organize your files using the suggested folder structure:

## 📌 Guidelines for Students
- Create a folder under `/students/` using your name (`name_surname`).
- For each project, create a subfolder and include a `README.md` explaining your work.
- Push your commits with meaningful messages (e.g., `Add PID controller testbench`).
- Do **not** commit large binary files (use Git LFS if needed).
- Respect academic integrity and follow lab ethics.
